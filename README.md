# The reason why the project may not work on your local environment
Since our project is constructed with a local mysql database, if your local environment dont have a local database, it wont work.
I added a function to automatically build the database, but not sure if it gonna work. Also, you need to change the code in app.py, line 40, mysql+pymysql://root:Zzy19980220,to "your user name":"your pwd"
